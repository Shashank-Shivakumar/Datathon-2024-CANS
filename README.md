# Hotel Booking Demand Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a worldwide hotel booking dataset. Our primary goal is to explore this dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and develop models to predict the likelihood of booking cancellations. By identifying trends and patterns, we aim to provide insights that can help in optimizing booking strategies and minimizing cancellations.

## Dataset
The dataset, `Booking_Data.xlsx`, includes the following columns:

- Booking ID
- Hotel
- Booking Date
- Arrival Date
- Lead Time
- Nights
- Guests
- Distribution Channel
- Customer Type

- Deposit Type
- Avg Daily Rate
- Status
- Status Update
- Cancelled (0/1)
- Revenue
- Revenue Loss

It encompasses a wide array of data points from hotel bookings, including booking details, customer information, and financial aspects.
